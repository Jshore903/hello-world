# hello-world

Hello Everyone!

My name is Jshore903 and I am an aspiring programmer/developer hoping to develop the skills to succeed. I was a combat medic in the Army, an exercise science major in college and currently a full time personal trainer. I have been learning Java, SQL, Javascript, JQuery, HTML5 and CSS3 recently. I hope to learn as much as I can and in the near future move on to expand to diffenent skills, such as Ruby, Python and Angular/Node.JS. 

I am excited and hope to learn something and improve everyday!
